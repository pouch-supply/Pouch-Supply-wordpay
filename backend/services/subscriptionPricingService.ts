/**
 * Scheduled subscription price changes.
 *
 * A price an admin changes today must not appear on a customer's card tomorrow:
 * a recurring charge going up needs notice. So a raised or lowered plan price is
 * recorded as a PENDING amount with a date it becomes effective, and the renewal
 * takes it only once that date has passed.
 *
 * The pending fields are deliberately not Prisma columns. The Subscription table
 * is reached through both Prisma and a JSON store, and `loadAllSubscriptions`
 * merges them with the JSON row spread first — so a key that exists only in the
 * JSON store survives, while adding a column would need a migration against a
 * database whose migration history is not tracked. `persistSubscriptionUpdate`
 * already filters Prisma writes to known columns and writes the whole record to
 * the JSON store, which is exactly the behaviour these fields need.
