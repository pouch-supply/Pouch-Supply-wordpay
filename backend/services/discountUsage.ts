 * entirely in the browser (`resolveDiscountCode`) and posts the resulting
 * discount object with the order, so a customer could re-enter the same code on
 * every order they ever placed and the server would take it each time.
 *
 * Checked here, against the orders that customer has actually placed — never
 * against a flag the client sent, which a crafted request controls. The rules
