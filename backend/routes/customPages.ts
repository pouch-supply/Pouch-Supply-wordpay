 * Because of that, saving pages can change what existing subscribers pay. The
 * hook below turns a plan price edit into a scheduled price change plus a notice
 * email for everyone already on that plan — without it, editing the price moved
 * only what new signups are quoted, and existing subscriptions billed the old
